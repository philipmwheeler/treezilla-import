Tools for bulk uploading data to Treezilla: the Monster Map of Trees

Treezilla: the Monster Map of Trees https:///treezilla.org is a citizen science project based at the Open University, UK. It is built on OpenTreeMap which was developed in the USA. Treezilla has taken OpenTreeMap and made it fit the UK, with the aim to map trees across the country.  
Data can be added to the site one tree at a time by individual citizen scientists, but a large amount of the site's data are contributed by organisations with their own databases of trees.  
The resources here are designed to manage the process of bulk uploading data.
